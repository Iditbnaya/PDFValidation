# PDFValidation
Encrypt PDF files and send them by Email.
There are two folders one for windows 7 and one for windows 10 That's because of the dll compatibility

Extract the folders and save the "PDFpassprotect" folder in the location you choose, the default is c:\temp but you can change it inside the code. 

In this script the password is the Client phone number - in my case it was the best option but you can change it to what ever you need. 

You will need to make some adjustments for your environment, look for the variables at the beginning of the script

have fun :)
